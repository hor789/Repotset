STM32 USB simulates CH341.ï¼ˆSTM32F103.PD0 connect 1.5k then connect D+)

Why CH341?
===============
* ST's USB virtual com port demo's driver have no signature(difficult to install).
* The driver of CH341 is easy to install.
* I feel bored.

It's not very difficult to develop. I just referred to the linux usb driver of ch341. You can simulate other chips in the same way.
